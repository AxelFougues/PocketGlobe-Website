MARKET RESEARCH

Existing Similar Applications:

The type of 'travel' application is most often oriented on the social sharing aspect (publication of experiences on social networks etc.) or on the 'intimate diary' aspect (possibility of writing your trip in the form of a 'story).
Data storage type applications are few and far between and unsuitable for the intended use.
In both cases, the possibilities for exporting or synchronizing are often limited and the features are chargeable.

Conclusion:

The proposed utility is not available on the market. Its variety of possible uses and its simple and customizable features are available to a diverse audience: travelers, sports practitioners, professionals in the field, event organizers, etc.
